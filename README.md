INTRODUCTION
-------------------
This neighborhood map site identifies cool spots in Oakland to visit whilst out for a night on the town.  
Locations may be selected via clicking the corresponding map marker or the venue name from the list in 
the sidebar.  Selecting a venue will bring up an infowindow containing information about that venue
pulled from its Foursquare article via API, as well as a Google Maps streetview of the venue.
Additionally, a text input field enables the user to narrow down the list of visible venues by typing 
in the venue name.
